# 4chan Mass Quotes browser extension

This browser extension aims to facilitate the creation of mass replies on 4chan.org and 4channel.org, and also reply to dubs. It may or may not work on other imageboards.

## Usage

Click on the toolbar icon when in a thread, and select one of two options. "Quote" quotes all the replies in the thread, and "Sneed" adds "sneed" at the end. "Copy To Clipboard" is self explanatory.

Tested on Firefox 73 for GNU/Arch Loonix, Microsoft Winblows 10 and Android 9

Was removed from the AMO for "spamming", eventhough that's not in the rules
